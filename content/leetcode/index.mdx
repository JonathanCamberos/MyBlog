## Arrays & Hashing:

Getting aquanted and learning how hashmaps and hashsets can solve wide 'array' of problems

### What is a Hashmap?
First lets understand what hashing is. Hashing is the process of transforming any given key 
or string of charactesr into another value. The result is normally a shorter, fixed-length
value that makes it computationally easier to work with than the original key.

Hashmaps, aka hashtable, are one of the most common implementations of hashing.
Hashmaps store key-value pairs (eg: employee ID / employee name) in a list that is 
accessible through its index.

A hash table uses a hash function to compute the index, aka hash code, into an arrary 
of buckets ro slots, from which the desired value can be found. 
During lookup, the same method is followed. The key is hashed and the resulting hash
indiates where the corresponding value is stored

### Hashmap benefits?
Hash tables are O(1) average if implemented well and O(n) worst case.
1. Hash tables suffer from O(n) worst time complexity due to two reasons:
If too many elements were hashed into the same key: looking inside this key may take
O(n) time.

Once a hash table has passed its load abalance - it has to rehash and create a bigger table/reinsert elements 

2. Hash tables are said to be O(1) average if implement well 
It is rare that many items will be hashed to the same key (if you used a good hash function
and dont have too big load balance) 

The rehash operation, which is O(n), can at most happen after n/2 ops, which are all
assumed O(1): Thus when you sum the average time per op, you get: (n*O(1) + O(n)) / n) = O(1)



## 217. Contains Duplicate

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, 
and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true


Solution 1: hashmap 

```python
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        
        seen = {}

        for num in nums:
            if num in seen and seen[num] >= 1:
                return True
            seen[num] = seen.get(num, 0) + 1
        return False
```

Solution 2: hashset
