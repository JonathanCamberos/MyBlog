HTML5 tags assist search engines in analyzing and understanding page structure and content, leading to improved on-page SEO for the webpage.
In contrast to the previous HTML versions, which only had a few tags, HTML5 offers more flexibility in defing our webpage.
These semantic tags are beneficial for serach engines to analze the complete content of the webpage

ex: these elemnts can be used to define the different sections of a web page: header, nav, footer 

Main tag: 
Notifies the serach engine of the main content of the page. The 'Main' tag contains the content or
article that is to be ranked in the search engine.
Note: 'Main' tag can't be a child of header, nav, article, aside, or footer, as this would be wrong practice

Article tag:
Used to speicifc the main article of the document.
Note: if you use 'article' under the 'main' tag, it will make more sense for the SEO of webpages

Header tag:
Tells the search engine about the main heading of the document
Note: main -> article -> header: heading of the content containing keywords for SEO
